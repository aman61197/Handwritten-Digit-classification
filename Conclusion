To get best results from a model you built from scratch for image classification : 
1) Use CNN.
2) Use dropout, data augmentation, different network architecture to prevent overfitting.

For Multiclass single label Classification :
1) Loss : categorical_crossentropy
2) Last layer activation : softmax
